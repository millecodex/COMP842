## COMP842 - Applied Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies
### Auckland University of Technology

As always this crypto space moves fast :rocket: and so this is a work in progress ðŸš§

The course website is hosted on Canvas (https://canvas.aut.ac.nz/courses/17343), however you need to be an enrolled student to login. This site serves as the open-source version. (You will still need to login to Canvas to view the assessment criteria and particiapate in the course discussion.) 

Lectures are Fridays 14:10-16:00 in WF702 beginning March 01, 2024. They may be recorded with links posted at the end of the notes.

This is the Graduate Level ðŸŽ“ version of [COMP726](https://github.com/millecodex/COMP726/), and as such has more detail, less in-class time (no tutorials), and overall adjusted expectations with respect to the quality and output of coursework. You may find some of the undergraduate tutorials helpful, although we won't be updating them.

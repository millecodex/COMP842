## COMP842 - Applied Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies
### Auckland University of Technology

As always this crypto space moves fast :rocket: and so this is a work in progress ðŸš§

The course website is hosted on Canvas (https://canvas.aut.ac.nz/courses/15421), however you need to be an enrolled student to login. This site serves as the open-source version. (You will still need to login to Canvas to view the assessment criteria and particiapate in the course discussion.) 

Lectures are Tuesdays 16:10-18:00 in WZ602 beginning July 18, 2023

This is the Graduate Level ðŸŽ“ version of [COMP726](https://github.com/millecodex/COMP726/), and as such has more detail, less in-class time (no tutorials), and overall adjusted expectations with respect to the quality and output of coursework. Occasionally we may have overalapping seminars and announcements with the undergrads.

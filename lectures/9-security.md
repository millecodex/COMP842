Divided into three pillars, security of a blockchain involves being prepared for many different attacks at the personal, community, and protocol levels. This list is not exhaustive and only represents some of the main security considerations that must be made when evaluating blockchains. Not every attack mentioned will be described, but there is an excellent source for blockchains security considerations [here](https://hackn.gitbook.io/l1-security/).

# Blockchain Security Taxonomy
Taking inspiration from the blockchain tech stack, we will orgnaize the security threats according to layers:
1. [Infrastructure Layer Security](#1-infrastructure-layer-security)
2. [Data Layer Security](#2-data-layer-security)
3. [Network Layer Security](#3-network-layer-security)
4. [Protocol (Consensus) Layer Security](#4-protocol-consensus-layer)
5. [Application Layer Security](#5-application-layer-security)

## 1. Infrastructure Layer Security

| Public vs Private Networks  | Node-Related     | Denial of Service  |
|-----------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Permissionless vs Permissioned | Node Compromise |  DoS |
|                              | Information Leakage  |                |

Denial of Service (DoS) and Sybil attacks (below, network) are common to all networking systems. The consensus protocol itself handles these attacks by making it prohibitively expensive for an attacker to spam the network and create multiple identities. Spamming results in an immediate loss of funds through fees or resources spent such as electricity. In a PoW chain, multiple identities require splitting one's computing power and receiving proportionally less reward per identity. Similarly, a proof of stake proportion of tokens must be divvied up between Sybils.

## 2. Data Layer Security

| Cryptographic       | Transaction Related     | Other Attacks    |
|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
|    Cryptanalysis   | Transaction Replay      | Length Extension  |
|  Hash Collision     | Transaction Malleability | False Top-Up      |
|                     | Time-Locked Transaction |                   |

Cryptanalysis and various cryptographic attacks will not be discussed here as they are not specific to blockchain networks.
**Transaction Replay** is a double-spend attack.

## 3. Network Layer Security

| P2P Components  | Data Integrity  | Resource Exhaustion | Routing & IPs  |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Sybil            | Eavesdropping   | Denial of Service   | BGP      |
| Eclipse         |                 |                       | Alien    |
|||                                                        | Timejacking     |



## 4. Protocol (Consensus) Layer

| Proof Mechanisms | Transaction Validation | Chain Manipulation   | Mining-Related      |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 51% (PoW)        | Race Attack*           | Long Range Attack    | Selfish Mining      |

|                  |                         |                      | Block Discarding    |
|                  |                         |                      | Block Withholding   |
|                  |                         |                      | Fork After Withholding |
|                  |                         |                      | Uncle-Block Attack  |

\* A type of double-spend attack

### 51% Attack
Should a single entity gain control of more than half of the hash power in the network, this could lead to a 51% attack. The attacker can't steal coins directly as this involves subverting elliptic curve cryptography. The attacker can, however, use their majority status in some interesting ways. At >50%, they have the ability to find more blocks and direct the consensus of the blockchain. The attacker can censor transactions by refusing to add blocks containing someone's address. This would be akin to blacklisting certain addresses but does not completely exclude them from being included in blocks mined by honest nodes (the 49%). As the proportion in control increases, it will be harder to get a blacklisted transaction published on the blockchain. With this majority, the attacker will now earn a larger proportion of block rewards but still have to find SHA256 hashes like everyone else.

The Proof-of-Stake equivallent to the 51% majority hashpower is the Byzantine Fault Tolerance limit which usually requires that at least 2/3rds of the validators must be honest for the network to function correctly. In BFT-based PoS systems, this means that an attacker would need to control more than 1/3rd of the total stake to compromise the network's safety properties, such as preventing agreement on the next valid block. In BFT systems like Tendermint or PoS Ethereum, the 2/3rd majority is crucial for achieving both safety and liveness properties. Safety ensures that nothing "bad" happens (e.g., double-spending), and liveness ensures that something "good" eventually happens (e.g., transactions get confirmed).

### Selfish Mining
An adversary doesn't necessarily need 51% of the hash power, but with a large number of nodes in the network, they could gain an advantage. An interesting analysis was published in 2014[^eyal] by Eyal and Sirer that showed a conglomerate of miners could form with as little as one-third of the hash power. This mining cartel can continuously mine without broadcasting their blocks until some set time in the future. In the short term, the miner is sacrificing the immediate block reward by not propagating their found blocks to neighboring nodes. In the long run, however, the result is that the honest miners are doing work that is not in competition with the selfish miners, increasing the attacker's expected rewards. The results of Eyal and Sirer's study conclude a group can increase their mining payout with as little as 1/3 of the network's hash power.

[^eyal]: Eyal, I., & Sirer, E. G. (2014). Majority is not enough: Bitcoin mining is vulnerable.

### Nothing at Stake
Given a fork in a proof of stake system, the user is incentivized to build on every branch. In a proof of work system, the user has a finite amount of hashpower that is most profitable if used to build on the main chain. This constraint is gone in a pure proof of stake system as the user can bid for blocks on any and all branches. The probability of finding a block remains constant. Here, the blockchain may never reach consensus as everyone is scrambling to build blocks rather than maintain the longest chain (BitFury, 2015).

A simple solution is to penalize someone who publishes blocks on multiple branches. This is known as slashing and acts as a disincentive to build on non-consensus chains (Buterin, 2017).

### Short and Long Range Attacks
A Long Range attack involves rebuilding a blockchain from scratch with the intention of overtaking main-chain consensus. A user with enough computational power could accomplish this easier than the same attack on a proof of work chain. To prevent an attacker from building a long competing chain, milestones can be reached along the way that act as finality checkpoints. Going back in time before a checkpoint is not possible as any other branches, including the potential attack, would be pruned. Ethereum uses validator nodes that vote on checkpoint blocks within an epoch.

In the short term, an attacker can attempt a double-spend by incentivizing participants to build on an orphaned chain as soon as a malicious transaction is broadcast. This is done secretly. If the alternate chain succeeds in overtaking the main chain, the double spend was successful. Basically, miners can be bribed to compete on the alternate chain, and this will be profitable up to the value of the double spend. Similar to the Nothing at Stake problem, a short-range attacker is penalized by slashing or revocation of validation privileges.

### Grinding
In a grinding attack, the attacker increases their probability of being selected for block minting. For example, a validator could iterate through many combinations of block parameters searching for a favorable one to get published. Given enough computing power, the attacker could always "find" a suitable block (Kiayias et al., 2019). A general mitigation measure for this is to use a source of randomness that cannot be known in advance, like a random function that uses seeds from a group of validators. Of course, the validators could work together and collude. Workarounds for this can be found in Ethereum's Proof of Stake FAQ.

### Smart Contracts
As the industry matures and well known SC exploits are learned from a number of best practices emerge. See the [smart contract security field guide](https://scsfg.io/hackers/) for best practices in smart contract development.

#### DAO Hack
The most famous smart contract exploit is the Ethereum **DAO hack** that took place in 2016 when a hacker drained US $50 million from a [fundraising account](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao#section-the-dao-hack-remedy-forks-ethereum). Here is some logic from the attack:

```solidity
contract donateDAO {
    mapping (address => uint256) public credit;

    // add funds to the contract
    function donate(address to) payable {
        credit[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    // show ether credited to address
    function assignedCredit(address) returns (uint) {
        return credit[msg.sender];
    }

    // withdrawal ether from contract
    function withdraw(uint amount) {
        if (credit[msg.sender] >= amount) {
            msg.sender.call.value(amount)();
            credit[msg.sender] -= amount;
        }
    }
}
```

The problem is in the `withdraw()` function. In line 17, `call.value()` sends funds, in this case to the sender, before updating the balance. Here, the hacker can request their funds back, and then a fallback function triggers a recursive call that keeps sending funds back without updating the balance[^Humiston2018]. The **reentrancy** attack took advantage of the fact that the smart contract logic allowed external calls to untrusted contracts before the internal state was updated. In simple terms, the attacker was able to repeatedly "re-enter" the smart contract and drain funds before the contract had a chance to update its internal record of withdrawals. This resulted in a substantial portion of the DAO's funds being siphoned off by the attacker.

[^Humiston2018]: Humiston, I. (2018). Attacks and Incidents. In Ethereum Smart Contract Development (pp. 81-94). Apress.

#### MEV
MEV refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from transaction reordering, transaction inclusion, and transaction censorship by validators within a block. Essentially, it quantifies the financial incentives for validators to deviate from the "honest" behavior expected of them. In Ethereum validators have the authority to choose the transactions that will be included in the next block. Because transactions pay fees to validators for their inclusion in a block, validators naturally prioritize transactions offering higher fees. However, the ability to choose transactions and their ordering within a block creates opportunities for MEV.

Validators can strategically reorder transactions to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities or even [front-run](https://hacken.io/discover/front-running/) specific transactions. Front-running involves placing a transaction ahead of another transaction in a block to take advantage of some profitable condition before the latter transaction can be executed. For example, if a trader is about to buy a large amount of a particular token, which is expected to increase the token price, a front-running validator can buy the token first and sell it after the trader's purchase, thereby making a profit.

Although mentioned here in the context of security, MEV is more of a consequence of the nature of fee market transactions in a decentralised system, rather than malicious behaviour.

### Exchanges & Scams
The list of hacks and breaches of cryptocurrency exchanges is long and colorful. A sampling can be found [here](https://www.hedgewithcrypto.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-hacks/) and includes a New Zealand (Christchurch based) company _Cryptopia_.

Outright scams are also prominent as Bitcoin becomes popular and increases in value, many 'alternatives' make the rounds promising massive gains and better features. The OneCoin scam was recently popularized in the excellent BBC podcast series _The Missing Queen_ by Jamie Bartlett. Episodes available [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nkd84/episodes/downloads). Often these types of scams are called **Rug Pulls** as the founders or one of the founders decides to abscond with user funds, often leaving nothing more than a trail of transaction history for victims to search.

### Mining Centralisation
The main practical threat to a single entity controlling the majority of the hashpower is that it will lead to centralization and cause users to abandon the system altogether. Once hashpower gets close to this threshold it is also possible that developers will step in and update the software to limit this behaviour. It is unknown how this will play out in the future. Thus far the bitcoin network has been relatively decentralized, but a few mega mining pools have emerged. There have been some cases of 51% attacks on alternative cryptocurrencies such as Verge, Horizen, and Vertcoin. Smaller cryptocurrencies are more vulnerable to a large mining pool shifting their resources for this purpose.

# What did we miss?
* There are a number of mining-related attacks; most of which are theoretical for Bitcoin because of its decentralisation and large network hashpower, but could be more practicle for smaller PoW based cryptocurrencies.

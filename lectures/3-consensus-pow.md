Lets now return to the question posed at the beginning: How can a blockchain protect against forged time-stamping? Each block contains a hash of the previous block, and \textit{that} block contains a hash the one before it, continuing back to the genesis block. So the hash of a single block is a digest or representation of the entire chain state up to that time. Any time a hash pointer is changed by a malicious actor all the subsequent blocks will also need to have their hash pointers updated. This process can require enormous amounts of computing power (energy and money) and incentivises nodes to act honestly according to the protocol.

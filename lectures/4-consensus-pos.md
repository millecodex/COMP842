## Proof of Stake
Proof of stake assumes that participants with the most personal value in the system will have an interest in maintaining operations. It closely relates to shareholding in a public corporation whereby shareholders are entitled to certain rights and expect the corporation to maintain or increase the value of their shares. Stake holders may be awarded voting rights in governance decisions such as disbursement of community funds or changes of protocol. Users are incentivised to maintain their share in the project through block creation and reward, fees, and potential increases in token value.

Block creation in a proof of stake system is proportional to the fraction of tokens someone holds. If a single entity has 5% of the tokens at stake, they can expect 5% of the block rewards. To stake tokens, one must have them committed to the blockchain network and thus can not spend or transfer them.

Ethereum is the largest project that has proof of stake as a goal. Ethereum started with a proof of work system and is planning on upgrading at some point in the future to a staking system. This was by design as bootstrapping token distribution in a cryptocurrency is not straightforward.

Proof of stake is a lightweight system that does not require substantial hardware investment such as mining equipment and therefore also does not have the electricity consumption. There is a low barrier to entry as you simply need to acquire some of the coin to participate. However, this could also allow a large player to influence the network by purchasing their way in.

## Summary

| | Centralized | Distributed (p2p) |
|---|---|---|
| Structure | Top-down; rules based | 1-node at a time; protocol based |
| Membership | Gatekeepers allow you to join and can expel/blacklist | Anyone can join (and leave) based on the protocol |
| Consensus | Voting and elections; democracy | Proofing methods: proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, etc.; meritocracy |
| Robustness | Fault-tolerant; no expected Byzantine actors | Fault and Byzantine tolerant |
| Incentive structure | Honesty enforced by legal structure of the corporation and therefore the state in which it operates | Honesty incentivised by some kind of reward (monetary, token, social, etc.) |
| Examples | Banks, Facebook, governments | Bit-torrent, email, wikis* & the internet* |
| Blockchain examples | Enterprise blockchains: Hyperledger (IBM/Linux), Azure (Microsoft), Quorum (JP Morgan) | Bitcoin, Ethereum, many other cryptocurrencies |
